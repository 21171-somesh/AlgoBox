# AlgoBox 
Algo-Box is aimed to be a utility tool that enhances the learning experience for people in the
programming world with chief focus on centralising different resources at a single place.
These resources may include :

● Library of well explained Algorithms and Data Structures : This brings up all the
Algorithms and Data Structures from basic to advanced level along with well explained
form and usable code.

● An open community for all: It’s a community of learners who help each other out as
well as contribute back by improving the content for everyone. A community not
only helps you when you’re stuck, it also keeps you accountable. Learning is more
fun when done together.

● Ever improving content: Every piece of content is a wiki, which means that anyone
can improve it. This ensures that the article you are reading is always up to date, and
what you write today will keep improving over time.

● Coding Calendar: A coding calendar so that you never miss out any Programming
contest or hiring challenge.

● Problem classifier:  It recommends problem to the users related to the topic they are
weak at.
